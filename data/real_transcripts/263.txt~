John August: Hello and welcome. My name is John August.</p>

Craig Mazin: My name is Craig Mazin.</p>

John: And this is Episode 263 of Scriptnotes, a podcast about screenwriting and things that are interesting to screenwriters. Today on the podcast we'll be doing another round of the Three Page Challenge, but this time with a twist. We'll also be looking at the 100 most frequently asked questions in screenwriting.
But, Craig, a couple episodes ago you were gone when Billy Ray was on because you had a terrible ear infection.</p>

Craig: Yeah.</p>

John: Today, this is my day for a gory ear story. Are you ready?</p>

Craig: I am. In fact, I'm more than ready. I'm thrilled.</p>

John: So, I guess a general trigger warning. If you do not like stories of ear pain, use the little chapter button to skip ahead right here. I'm going to give you the quick lowdown on what happened with my ear today.
So, as you all know, I'm leaving for Paris in less than a week.</p>

Craig: Boo.</p>

John: And so I have to do all of these doctor's appointments for the doctors I will not see over the year that I'm in Paris. Today was the allergist. And the allergist was fine, no issues, but she was looking in my left ear and she said, 'You know what? You have a lot of wax build up here. I'm going to send the nurse in and she'll get that wax out.'
I'm like, great. So it's like a paid Q-tip. So she comes in and she has this amazing instrument I'd never seen before. It's like a plastic pick, a clear plastic pick that has a hoop on the end and then attaches to a little light, so she can use that to look inside and see the wax and get it all off. And I'm like well this is amazing. A new technology. I was so excited, until she put it in my ear.</p>

Craig: Hmm.</p>

John: It was one of the most painful experiences of my entire life.</p>

Craig: This is not a gory story at all. This is what happens to me four times a year. I thought for sure there was going to be blood or they were going to find a worm or a nest of spiders.</p>
